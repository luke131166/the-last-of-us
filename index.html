										<h2>Welcome!</h2>
										<p>Personal Information<br />
										& Interest in IT</p>
									</header>
									<p>Hi, my names Luke. I am currently studying IT at RMIT whilst working full time a part of a retail management team. Although I was born here, my Mum is from Turkey, where I get my cultural background from. I have not yet learnt the language; however, I am conversational in Japanese as apart of cultural interest and previous studies. I finished my VCE at Essendon Keilor College, but now reside near Melbourne’s southeast shores. My favourite hobby in my downtime is working on and driving cars! I currently own a 1994 Toyota Supra that I have rebuilt after being rear ended 2 months after getting the car. It has taken over a year, but it is now looking better than ever!</p>
									<p>My main interest in IT is how vast and huge the world has become due to the development of it. IT is magical, because it allows us to access anything from across the world in real time and share any occasion with friends and family, no matter where they are.</p>
									<p>I first got interested in IT from my love of gaming. I was a complete nerd and would play for hours on end with my brother, always challenging each other to be the best, however he would always come out on top due to the age difference. Now that I am 21, he does noteven compare to me in some of the games we still play to this day! If anyone was wondering, RuneScape is where it all began, where I further got more into gaming with my new love for World of Warcraft. Nerdy, I know, but it made me who I am today. </p>
									<p>I have IT experience mainly from self-learning such as video editing, programming, development and photo editing.</p>
									<p>I decided to study at RMIT from all the great feedback I have heard from my friends and colleagues, as well as the flexibility from studying from home rather than in campus as I have a tight work schedule to meet! This means that in my downtime I can focus on my studies at the right times, rather than missing classes and lectures due to other commitments.</p>
									<p>I hope to learn and develop my skills in IT as well as build a career path for myself in the future to be able to work in an ever-growing industry that I enjoy! Game development, programming and video editing are all things that I am interested in, so I am aiming to expand my knowledge on these and other aspects of IT to be able to confidently build myown portfolio of projects.</p>

									<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
									<p>An ideal job I have looked at is becoming a Front-End Developer.</p>
									<p>The position would involve becoming The Senior Engineer at A2B Australia and I would be 
									tasked with working on multiple projects and creating and supporting programs that help to 
									deliver a more immersive experience for passengers and drivers for the company. I would 
									be based in the Mulgrave office, so I would still be close to family and friends and have 
									access VIA car transport, rather than having to take public transport. Some of the 
									responsibilities include but are not limited to –</p>
									<p>• Continuing the success of 13cabs booking systems.<br />
									• Learning the newest technologies and procedures to grow my own personal skillset.<br />
									• Increase and maintain technical capabilities and productivity of back-end services and API.<br />
									• Maintain and develop current and future products & systems with structured and modern methods of coding.</p>
									<p>The skills, qualifications and experience that are required for the position include but are not limited to –</p>
									<p>• 7+ years’ experience in creating commercial products and applications of code.<br />
									• Extensive experience in many different programming languages such as C# and .NET<br />
									• Strong leadership skills to be able to manage and mentor other team members.<br />
									• Familiar with different database software such as SQL and NoSql.<br />
									• The ability to adhere to modern quality standards of documentation and coding.</p>
									<p>The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have towards the job are –</p>
									<p>• Great leadership skills and mentoring ability with people of different ages & cultural background<br />
									• Ability to learn quickly on the job or off the job, dedicated to learning new ways to work effectively and efficiently.<br />
									• Enthusiastic towards the business goals and aim as it is a business that I find interesting, with the work being something I’m eager to improve on and learn more about to expand my knowledge and skills.</p>
									<p>I would love to finish my studies and major in programming to be able to extend my knowledge on the many different languages and programming tools I would have to use in the position.</p>
									<p>As it is a senior roll, I would have to work from the bottom up, starting with a more basic 
									level of programming to learn the tools and knowledge I would need to success in this 
									business. I also aim to become apart of the leadership team of wherever I work, as I love 
									being able to successfully manage and create a healthy work environment for all team
									members and support their goals. This would help strengthen my current skills in a 
									leadership position which I already enjoy being apart of.</p>

									<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
									<p>Through the Myewrs-Briggs test, I have found that I am a “Protagonist”. This shows that I 
									am extraverted, intuitive, a feeler rather than a thinker, judging when it comes to my 
									approach to work and turbulent.</p>
									<p>I am seen to be a “natural-born leader” – passionate and charismatic. </p>
									<p>Through an online learning style test from eductionplanner.org, I have discovered I am an Auditory Learner. This means that I learn best by hearing and listening and can understand and remember things that I have heard.</p>
									<p>Some things that I have learnt can help me to learn better are the following –<br />
									• Sit where I can hear. <br />
									• Use flashcards to learn new words and read them out loud. <br />
									• Read assignments, directions, or stories out loud to better process them.<br />
									• Study new material by reading it out loud.</p>
									<p>Through a Big Five Personality Test, I have discovered different traits I share with the 5 
									factors – Extroversion, Emotional Stability, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and 
									Intellect/Imagination. Here are my scores –</p>
									<p>
									- Extroversion: 86<br />
									- Emotional Stability: 19<br />
									- Agreeableness: 76<br />
									- Conscientiousness: 62<br />
									- Intellect/Imagination: 91</p>
									<p>This shows that I am great with people, are easy to agree with, somewhat conscious about 
									other people and intelligent, however I have poor emotional stability, which I can currently 
									see in my personal relationships. Although I scored low, I am always trying to grow and learn 
									more about myself as a person and am doing what I can to learn and make sure I do not 
									make the same mistakes twice, especially when it comes to emotions and negative thought
									patterns.</p>
									<p>These results from the 3 different tests have shown me that I am a good leader, learn easier 
									by hearing and seeing visuals and am extroverted when it comes to other people, however I 
									can be emotionally unstable (on my own scale). </p>
									<p>These results will influence my behaviour as a team in the following ways –</p>
									<p>
									• I am great at leading in a team environment.<br />
									• I am compassionate about my teammates and colleagues and will make sure their 
									wellbeing is top priority in a project (assist with delegation of tasks, keep track of 
									how people are going with a project and how they are feeling - a happy worker is a 
									productive worker).<br />
									• Can communicate effectively and are not shy to assist other people in a team 
									environment – able to see where people may be struggling or achieving, giving me 
									the ability to help people grow their weaker skills, but also delegate the correct tasks 
									to the correct people.<br />
									• Can sometimes react too emotionally without first thinking – this would negatively 
									impact the team as I may be unable to properly analyse my own feelings, rather than 
									being able to remove my personal thoughts and think more critically. This is 
									something I am aware of and constantly attempting to build upon, learning how to 
									properly separate my feelings from a situation and not think clearly.</p>
									<p>When forming a team, it is a must that I can connect with other people – I am a social 
									creature and love being able to help and collaborate with peers to be able to create 
									something amazing, rather than trying to tackle the whole task myself or watch my peers’
									struggle. This is especially a must when gaining a leadership role, as I must be able to make 
									sure my team’s wellbeing is a priority and that everyone is capable of the tasks delegated to 
									them.</p>

									<h3>Project Idea</h3>
									<p><b>Overview</b></p>
									<p>We would all love to work with our friends and build a community together, right? That is
									exactly what I plan to do. I love cars as much as other people love animals, to me they are 
									something to care for, love and appreciate.</p>
									<p>I would love to create a community/business that aims to help endorse charities and the 
									general community through a multitude of business applications and media outlets.</p>
									<p>The main branches of my project would include an array of different business prospects that 
									use various forms of IT to create a wide business and community.</p>
									<p><b>Motivation</b></p>
									<p>My motivation to create a project like this is to integrate the many useful forms of IT to 
									create a community and platform for people who love the same passion as me. There are 
									many different places for people to find information, products and learn on many different 
									websites, institutions and shops – however there is not a place that easily integrates all 
									these aspects together to create a one-stop place for enthusiasts.</p>
									<p><b>Description/Tools & Technologies</b></p>
									<p>The general idea is to have the following all merged into a single platform –</p>
									<p>
									• Online forum<br />
									• Website to purchase products (such as merchandise or parts).<br />
									• Online media/video outlet that helps to inspire, teach and entertain customers.<br />
									• A workshop/mechanic to fix, restore and/or modify cars.<br />
									• Interactive site which people can record, edit and view their own personal 
									goals/achievements and share with others.</p>
									<p>There is not a single place that people can go to find all these different products/outlets.
									Although there are many places’ people can find what they are looking for in the world of 
									cars, there is no place in which people can go to successfully achieve all their goals and be 
									able to share and collaborate with one another in all these fields.</p>
									<p>The main idea is to have a website, which integrates forums, shops, social media, personal 
									blogs, and contact points for people to physically purchase services from a qualified
									workshop.</p>
									<p>The product would contain different IT applications in all these branches such as –</p>
									<p>
									• A dedicated server is to be created for the website to be hosted on. This would 
									increase the websites performance and be able to optimally handle the high load of 
									the website through the amount of people that could be using it at the same time.<br />
									• An implemented phone/chat support that can assist people in need with exploring 
									our many products and resources we have to offer.<br />
									• Have an easy-to-use interface which will successfully direct people to where they 
									need to go – this will be achieved with a great Front End Developer, who’s job it is to 
									make sure people are able to access the site efficiently and effectively.<br />
									• High server security using a Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). With all the 
									information that will be stored on the website, it is a must that this information is 
									not stolen to be used by a third party – everyone’s privacy should remain safe.<br />
									• Daily backups of the server’s content, as to reverse possible changes that are made 
									which can delete/destroy content that people upload, share or store (such as blogs).<br />
									• Integrated blog & forum using a third-party provider such as WordPress using a 
									cPanel hosted server.<br />
									• The use of car tuning software in automotive engineering/development (prevalent at 
									physical workshop). There are many great tuning platforms and software that can be 
									used to do so, such as Toad Pro and Elite Software Programmer (ESP).<br />
									• Online shop in the website that integrates the use of payment providers such as 
									PayPal, Visa & Mastercard. This way, it is accessible to most people to be able to buy 
									any of the products, as PayPal can use most payment methods through their own 
									services, which is then translated to the website as a secured method of payment. A 
									similar software to Shopify can be used to achieve this, or a custom-made software 
									that can create invoices, receive payments through the any of the provided methods 
									and confirm orders for pick-up or delivery. Shopify is a great way to implement an 
									online store into a website, with over 1,700,000 businesses worldwide that use the
									current product.<br />
									• Integrated media support can be used on the website through other media outlets 
									such as YouTube, or create a platform that saves users uploaded data to the server 
									to be played to other users on the website. A quick way to do this is to implement 
									WordPress on the website to be able to integrate embedded links from external 
									sources to be played on the page.</p>
									<p><b>Skills Required</b></p>
									<p>There are many skills required to bring this project to life. Webhosting is something that is 
									most needed, followed by software such as WordPress or similar created software to 
									implement videos, forums and blogs into the website, the usage of cPanel and SQL 
									databases to store information and integrate third party sources into the website. </p>
									<p>There needs to be a Front End & Back End developer who needs to have a variety of skills 
									such as programming, ability to adapt code in different languages to create a smooth 
									experience. There are many people with the skills required to build websites and use these</p>
									<p>different platforms all around the world – integrating them into one is the main objective of 
									this project. </p>
									<p>There are lots of special hardware involved in this project, such as the physical hardware in 
									the workshop, however lots of computers, network storage and server hardware are 
									required to create a website that can function using all of these tools.</p>
									<p><b>Outcome</b></p>
									<p>If my project is a success, it will help to position car enthusiasts all around the world to be 
									able to do what they love, explore, collaborate and connect with one another through a 
									single platform where they can find the answers they are looking for or just enjoy 
									community-based entertainment through videos, forums or blogs.</p>
									<p>It will be able to be accessed from people all around the world, however the more physical 
									workings of the business would for customers in Australia, as they would need to physically 
									transport their cars to the service, however the online store would allow us to ship parts (if 
									legal) to other countries all around the world with simple payment methods and delivery 
									services being used.</p>
									<p>It will impact the world as we know it, as it will create lots of opportunity for people around 
									the world to be able to source information and products in one place, saving time and 
									recourses for all involved.</p>
